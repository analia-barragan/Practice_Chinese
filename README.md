# Practice Chinese Vocabulary
A tool to review and practice Chinese characters.

# Description

This personal project is aimed at creating a tool that can help a user review chinese vocabulary asking them for the pinyin, 
pronunciation (tones), and meaning of specific words.
This application will have two parts. One part will be responsible for quizzing the user on the vocabulary, the other part
will allow the user to add more vocabulary to be quizzed on. 

The tool will be developed and tested in Jupyter Notebooks and then converted into a Python Script that can run on the command line.
